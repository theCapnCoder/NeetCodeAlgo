// Here's what I changed and improved:

// Functions for Character Count: I created a function called countCharacters
// that takes a string and returns an object with character counts.
// This function makes the code more modular and reusable.

//Comparison Function: I created a function called compareCharacterCounts 
//that takes two strings and compares their character counts.
//This function uses the countCharacters function and compares
//the resulting objects using JSON.stringify.
//This approach is more robust than comparing sizes and also takes character frequencies into account.

//Improved Naming: I used more descriptive function and variable names to make the code's purpose clearer.

//Removed Unnecessary Checks: The original code checked for
//character count mismatch using set sizes.
//I removed this part and used the more accurate character count comparison.

// Consistent Formatting: I formatted the code consistently for better readability.

// Please note that I've removed the original addSymbol and deleteSymbol 
//functions as they weren't being used in the provided code. 
//If you still need those functions, you can adapt them in 
//a similar manner to the countCharacters function I provided.
